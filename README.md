# kotlin-learning-path

Idea is to learn how to do same thing I'm doing in Java but using Kotlin

Initial expectations:

* component to get data from an API (GitHub?)
  * Use spring for DI
  * Reactive?
  * Use OAuth (client credentials)
  * integrate with some queue (Kafka? would be nice to implement delays and retries with it)
  * Expose REST API (check how boring it is to implement endpoints. J)
  * Testing (check syntax, tools for mocking behavior)
